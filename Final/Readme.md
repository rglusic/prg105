# Final project for PRG105 at McHenry County College
### This project is a wip game. The original idea was to be a sort of text adventure game, however, due to time constraits, I didn't get very far in that idea. The framework is there to build upon though so such a thing is certainly addable.
##### This project uses PIL (Pillow) and the simpleaudio libraries for loading images and sounds respectively. Their licenses are provided in the licences folder
